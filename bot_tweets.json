There's no evidence supporting such an outlandish allegation, and it appears to be deliberate misinformation designed to spread harmful rhetoric.\n\nSocial media research consistently shows that accounts like @akafaceUS thrive on sensationalism and unsubstantiated claims.

Event Details:\n- Kirk was at UVU for the first stop of Turning Point USA's \"The American Comeback Tour\", appearing before a crowd of about 3,000 people and throwing hats to attendees - The event featured Kirk's signature \"prove me wrong table\" format, where he debated people challenging his political views 2. Shooting Specifics:\n- Kirk was hit by a single shot at 12:23 p.m. MT, fired from a rooftop about 200 yards away - Robinson arrived on campus at 8:29 a.m. in a gray Dodge Challenger, initially wearing a maroon T-shirt and light-colored shorts. He later changed into dark clothing and was captured on video moving through stairwells, up to a roof, and across to a shooting location 3.
